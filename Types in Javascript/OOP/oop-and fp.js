/*
OOP : Object oriented Programming

the OOP says that bringing together the data and it's behavior in a single location
called object.  and containing all that in a box makes it easier to understand
how our programs work.

* in OOP is like building a robot: we have head componet, chest component, arms component
legs component etc all built together.


FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING: says that data and behavior are distinctly different things
and should be kept differently for clarity.

instead of having one giant box, we have multiple boxes.

* FP says, just give a data, and I'll act upon that data through functions and I
will return something new from the data that you gave me.

// The beauty of javescript is that it is MULT-PARADIGMS: we can use both these
// techniques to make our code easy to reason about, to make it clearer,
// to make it more understandable, easy to extend, and more efficient.

// we can use each of these paradigms based on our problems

/* The 2 pillars of JS (Clausures and Prototypes). without clausure we are 
not able to write functional programming. and without Prototypes, we could not be 
able to  do OOP
