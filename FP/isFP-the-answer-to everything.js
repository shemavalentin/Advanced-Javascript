WHY ARE PEOPLE ARE SO EXCITED ABOUT FUNCTINAL PROGRAMMING?

The idea with functional programming is this idea of separation 
of data and functions or data and the effects that happen on that data.

If you try to perform effects and logic at the same time, the problem is that
you may create hidden side effects which cause a lot of bugs.

When you use the fp principles as follow, you build something complex but with
small parts that build big things.

1. Task
2. Returns statement
3. pure
4. No share state
5. Immutable state
6. Composable
7. Predictable



It doesn't mean that functional programming the answer to everything. 
Yes because of it's nature, it works very well with distributed systems
that have little different machine all over the world working with each orher

or parallelism where multiple things have to happen in  parallel, but because
there functions are pure, they don't cause strange bugs


BUT IT DEPENDS ON THE PROBLEM YOU HAVE.

There a time that OOP could be a good answer to the priblem.
