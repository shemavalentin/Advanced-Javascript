/*
WHAT IS FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING?

Functional programming is all about separation of conserns,
which object oriented programming does as well.

It is all about packaging our code into separate chunks
so that everything is well organized, and each part of our code
concerns itself with one thing it's good at.

In functional Programming there is this idea of separation of concern,
but they also separate data and function.

That is a function programmer views the world as, well, there is data
and then this data gets interacted with. there is no real function but 
functional programming puts imphasis on simplicity where data and 
functions are concerned. we separate them up.


When it comes to functional programming, we have only one pillar:
PURE FUNCTIONS. and unlike in OOP where we have 4 pillars such as
ENCAPSULATION, ABSTRACTION, POLYMORPHISM, AND INHERTANCE  in FP we
only have one. if you want to break things down in FP, you use this
answer. Pure functions.

The idea in Pure Function is the separation of data of a program,
and the behavior of a program. and all objects created in functional
programming are immutable(Once something is created, it can not change),
we avoid things like shared state, and we adhere to the principal of
pure function.

Functional programming has a lot of restraints, rules to not give 
permission to everyone so that codes are not out of our hands.
