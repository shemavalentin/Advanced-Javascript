1. Memory Efficient
2. Encapsulation

/*
We are creating a bigArray, filling in it some entries, adding data into
our memory which we have limited memory.

we are creating it everytime. every time we run this function, we create that
memory that hold that array and then we return it. And because nothing is referencing it
it get destroyed. this doesn't sound very efficient. Would it be great if there was
a way for us to create this array. and because we know it is going to be used alot
to only create it once and just have it in memory therefore we can access it instead 
of doing all that work.how can we do that with closures.
